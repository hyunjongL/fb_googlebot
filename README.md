# googlebot

### What is it?
Its a bot!
If you send a message to the facebook page you've connected to, you can get the "GOOGLE SEARCHED RESULTS" by message.
(At this moment)You'll get top10 links and some snippets(short explanations).
+ Based on Node.js, Uses https, fs, string_decoder

### Why not Google it?
There are people who cannot connect to Google, but can to facebook.
So, AWS lambda serves as a broker!
It catches the word recieved by my FB page and queries using Google Custom Search API.


How-to-use
  1. Get an AWS account, Google Custom Search API and a Facebook Page.
  2. Get a AWS Lambda and connect it to your Facebook page that the page interrupts Lambda when you recieve a message.
  3. Copy the index.js to your lambda server's code and enter YOUR_VARIABLES to the code.
  4. Try it out!
  
 * you should know that your google api's daily usage may be limited if you are not paying for it!
